| --- | --- |
| Scope | Voltage violations avoidance in distribution and transmission grid by use of flexibility resources connected to transmission and distribution system providing ancillary services through a market mechanism. <br/> Networks: MV, LV (HV users have their own market) <br/> Markets: Day Ahead, Near Real Time|
| **Objective(s)** | * To support the TSO to use the flexibility provided by the resources connected to the distribution system for congestion management, while respecting distribution system constraints <br/> * To ensure an inclusive and non-discriminatory access to the market *for all agents that provide grid services* <br/> * To enable coordination between system operators <br/> * To *optimize* the distribution network utilization <br/> * To activate *flexibility to solve voltage violations in the distribution grid* <br/> * To *minimize RES curtailment due to technical requirements and operation constraints*|

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**

This BUC describes the main steps to avoid congestion in transmission and distribution systems. The DSO can use flexible resources connected to the distribution system and TSO can use flexible resources connected to transmission and distribution systems after the DSO’s approval. The power flow is assessed and monitored respectively by DSO and TSO, in order to keep the electrical quantities within admissible ranges.

**Complete description**

add text - longer narrative from user viewpoint about *what* happens *how*, *where*, *when*, *why* and *under which assumptions*. It has to be written in a way that it can also be understood by non-experts.

***Notes:***
* **Relation to other use cases** - relation to other use cases in the same project or thematic area. Possible relation types are for instance include, extend, invoke, or associate.
* **Level of depth** - reflects the degree of specialisation of the use case. Although no common notation is settled, descriptions like high level use case, generic, detailed, or specialised use case are often used.
* **Prioritisation** - helps to rate the use cases in a project from very important to nice-to-have with labels like obligatory/mandatory or optional which have to be agreed upon beforehand.
* **Generic, regional or national relation** - for the purpose of generalisation if use case is applied to areas where restictions by law or silimiar issues occur.
* **Nature of the use cases** - describes the viewpoint and field of attention like *technical, political, business/market, test*, etc.

***Notes***
This part describes the possible scenarios of the use case. The scenarios should comply with the sequence diagrams in Sect. 2 of the template, so that every step describes one part of a communication or action. Apart from a normal success scenario, different failure scenarios or alternatives can be included to describe situations where preconditions are not satisfied or unwanted states are attained.
* **Primary Actor** - the first actor appearing in the scenario at the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Triggering Event** - the incident causing the scenario to begin.
* **Pre-Condition** - indicates which terms have to be fulfilled for the scenario to be executed.
* **Post-Condition** - indicates which terms should be valid after the scenario. TIt can also specify whether a scenario has been successfully completed or not.

* **Service** - addresses the nature of the information flow. Possible: GET (The information receiver obtains information from the
information producer after an implicit request.), CREATE (The information producer creates an information object.), CHANGE (The information producer performs an update of the information at the information receiver’s.), DELETE (The information producer deletes information of the receiver.), CANCEL/CLOSE (A process is terminated.), EXECUTE (An action or service is performed.), REPORT (The information producer supplies information of its own account.), TIMER (The actor which represents both information producer
and receiver has to enforce a waiting period.), REPEAT (A number of steps has to be repeated until a break condition (stated in the field Event) is satisfied. The contemplated steps have to be added in parentheses.).
* **Information Producer and Receiver (Actor)** - actors from actor list in section 3.1
