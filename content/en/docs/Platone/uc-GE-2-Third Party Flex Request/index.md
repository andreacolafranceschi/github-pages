## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

*Scope and objectives of use case*

|||
| --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly high installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency. Use Case 2 demonstrates how the flexibility required to enable a local balancing mechanism could temporarily be allocated to other uses, for example the provision of flexibility to a third party, e.g. the connecting grid operator. Use Case 2 uses the available flexibility in a given local energy community to maintain an externally defined non-zero setpoint at the point of connection. <br/> Networks: LV <br/> Markets: None|
| **Objective(s)** | Maintain a fixed non-zero power exchange between energy community and the distribution network for a limited duration. |
| **Related business case(s)** | Integration of local energy communities in network management strategies for the stabilization and uniform utilization in distribution grid |

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**

Local energy communities are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case. Situations could arise that require the community to provide flexibility to third parties – driven by technical circumstances or following economic considerations (market incentives). Use Case 2 demonstrates the ability and practical feasibility of a local community to maintain constant non-zero power exchange with the distribution network for a previously defined duration.

**Complete description**

The community is consuming and/or generating energy. A user (in the case of the field trial the DSO) triggers the EMS to apply Use Case 2 and sets a target value (P’Breaker) for the power exchange at the grid connection. The EMS (ALF-C) processes weather forecasts and measurement values from the grid connection and flexible assets such as BESS, household energy storages and flexible loads located in the community. Based on the data and historic values the EMS forecasts the local generation and demands and determines the best strategy to reach (P’Breaker) by utilizing the available flexibility to keep the power flow constant for a pre-defined duration. <br/> The EMS communicates with sensors through the Blockchain Access Platform and DSO Technical Platform and handles all data in a dedicated data base. The DSO Technical Platform provides encryption and decryption in the whole IT infrastructure. Control signals are routed through the DSO technical platform and the Blockchain Access Platform to flexible devices, if applicable through a third-party backend that connects to the hardware.
